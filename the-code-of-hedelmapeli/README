My first-ever project in the programming world. This game was part of the execution of course "Programming 1" in the University of Jyväskylä. 
The idea of the game is to collect the oranges and to avoid the bombs. The point-counter will add points for each fruit collected, but when 
a bomb hits the basket, lives will be reduced by one. The game itself is really simple, but as I said, it's the first one. 

Some things I learned during the process:

- Creating functions, procedures, methods
- How to make collide two different objects
- Documenting 
- I have to think first before acting, it's an easy way to avoid mistakes and a possible repetition
- Causal relationships of different things
- Debugging (a little)

I think I spent approximately fifty to sixty hours doing this project.
